            <pre><h1>     PRIVACY POLICY </h1><div class="privacy">
             A privacy policy is a legal document that informs your site’s users about how you collect and handle their personal information.
             You may also hear privacy policies referred to by the following names:
    
                -Privacy notice
                -Privacy policy statement
                -Privacy page
                -Privacy clause
                -Privacy agreement
            
           A general privacy policy explains a platform’s interactions with the personal information and personally
            identifiable information (PII) of its users. PII is information that can be used by itself, or combined
             with other information, to identify an individual.
           
             Specific platforms or services may require a unique privacy policy template. Examples include:
           
                -app privacy policies
                -privacy policies for Blogger
                -WordPress privacy policies
                -ecommerce privacy policies
                -small business privacy policies
           
            However, a standard privacy policy template will likely satisfy user demands and legal requirements for
            your website.Standard Privacy Policy for Website. We’ll dive into details later on in What to Include 
            in Boilerplate Privacy Policy, but a basic privacy policy outlines the following:
            
                -What information is collected
                -Where information is collected fromWhy information is collected
                -How information is collected (including through cookies and other tracking technologies)
                -Who information is shared with or sold toWhat rights users have over their data
                -The site’s contact details
            
            Privacy policies should be clear, thorough, and easy for internet users to find on any given site.

             11.Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. 
            The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
            United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable
            information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
            exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to
            comply with this policy.
            According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
            0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;
            0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our
                website;
            0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
            0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at
                abclearningcentre@gmail.com.
            Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:
            We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track
                browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform
                websites that you do not want to be tracked.
            You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.

                your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain
                requests and ask us:
            0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:

            0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any
                other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of that
                fact.
            0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along

                    the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use
                    certain functions that require your personal information to operate.

                    third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration.

                    our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California
            law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any
            time.
            If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.
